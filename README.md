# dotfiles
Steal anything you want.

Run `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git` inside `zsh/plugins` folder. 

Also put these in your `.zprofile` to override the `zsh` and `nvim` folder configuration defaults:

```
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME/.dotfiles/zsh"
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.dotfiles"
```
